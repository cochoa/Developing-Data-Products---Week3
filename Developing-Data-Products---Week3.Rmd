```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Data

We use a dataset with geolaction of the main cities in Spain, as well as data regarding male and female population, region and province.

```{r data, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
cities <- read.csv("CitiesGeoloc.csv", sep=";", encoding = "UTF-8")
names(cities) <- c("region","province","city","lat","lng","altitude","population","males","females")
str(cities)
cities<-cities[cities$population>10000,]

```

## Plot.ly example

```{r plotly, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, comment="", message=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data=cities, x=~altitude, y=~population, color=~region,  type="scatter")

```
